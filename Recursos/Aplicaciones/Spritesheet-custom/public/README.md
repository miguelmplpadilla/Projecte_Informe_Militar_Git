Universal LPC Spritesheet Character Generator
=============================================

Based on [Universal LPC Spritesheet](https://github.com/jrconway3/Universal-LPC-spritesheet).

Try it out [here](https://sanderfrenken.github.io/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator/).

The project you are looking now is an expansion on the above mentioned projects. I try to include all LPC created art up to now.

The Liberated Pixel Effort is a collaborative effort from a number of different great artists who helped produce sprites for the project.
Please read the [authors](AUTHORS.txt) file for the full list of authors who have contributed to the spritesheet.

If you want to know how to include sprites from this sheet into your work, please visit the [Open Game Art LPC forums](http://opengameart.org/forums/liberated-pixel-cup).
You will need to credit everyone who helped contribute to the LPC sprites you intend to use if you wish to use LPC sprites in your project.

### Licensing

According to the rules of the LPC all art submissions were dual licensed under both GNU GPL 3.0 and CC-BY-SA 3.0. These art submissions are considered all images present in the directory `spritesheets` and it's subdirectories. Further work produced in this repository is licensed under the same terms.

### Run

To run this project, just clone the repo and open ``index.html`` in your browser of choice.

### Caution

This is not an example of a perfectly coded project, and it does have bugs.
In my current project I am using the generator to create a vast amount of awesome different characters, and the results are beautiful.

Still, feel free to enhance the code where you like, but for now, I focus on just adding content.

### Status

Support still working on:

- [Teens](https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-teen-unisex-base-clothes)
- [Triumph](https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-major-triumph)
- [Skorpios](https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-skorpios-scifi-sprite-pack)
